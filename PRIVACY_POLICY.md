# Privacy Policy

The Gamepad Navigator allows the user to navigate Chromium-based browsers and web pages using a game controller. It
provides various features that allow navigation using gamepad such as web page scrolling, tab navigation, click on
buttons and hyperlinks, et cetera. Due to the nature of browser and web page navigation, the Gamepad Navigator requires
permission to interact with the content in the active web pages, browser windows, and tabs.

## Information the Gamepad Navigator collects

The Gamepad Navigator provides some web page navigation features that involve interaction with the web page's content.
To perform certain navigation features (for example, tab navigation) correctly, the elements on the web page may be
parsed. In addition, the Gamepad Navigator may use the custom gamepad configuration map provided by the user using the
configuration panel.

## How the Gamepad Navigator uses the information

The Gamepad Navigator is directed by the user's game controller to perform browser and web page navigation according to
the configuration map set by default or as provided by the user. Some of the navigation features require access to the
elements on the web page and perform relevant operations, as needed, For example, "tab navigation" requires filtering
and sorting the tabbable/clickable elements on the web page prior to performing the action.

## What information does the Gamepad Navigator share

The Gamepad Navigator does not explicitly share any information. The gamepad configuration map provided using the
configuration panel is stored locally within the extension for persistence across multiple browser sessions. Elements
parsed from the web pages are only stored temporarily.
